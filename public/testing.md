Below is a **realistic, India-specific, 10-year roadmap to become a millionaire** (₹8–9 crore net worth ≈ $1M), **without lottery thinking**. This is built around **skills, income growth, investing, and leverage**—not shortcuts.

I’ll assume:

* You’re in your 20s–30s  
* You’re technical (you already build products / platforms)  
* You’re willing to grind intelligently for 5–7 years

---

# **What “Millionaire” Means in India**

* **$1,000,000 ≈ ₹8.3–9 crore (future inflation adjusted)**  
* Target: **₹9 crore net worth in 10 years**  
* This requires **high income \+ disciplined investing \+ equity/business leverage**

You **cannot** reach this with:

* Salary-only mindset  
* FD \+ mutual fund SIPs alone  
* Passive income fantasies

You **can** reach it with:

* **Skill → Income → Ownership → Scale**

---

# **HIGH-LEVEL STRATEGY (Non-Negotiable)**

You need **at least ONE** of these engines:

1. **High-income tech career \+ investing**  
2. **Startup / SaaS / product business**  
3. **Equity-heavy freelancing / consulting**  
4. **Real estate \+ strong cash flow (secondary engine)**

👉 Given your background, **Tech \+ Product \+ Ownership** is your fastest path.

# **MINDSET RULES (Most Important)**

1. **Ownership \> Salary**  
2. **Skills before money**  
3. **Boring consistency beats hype**  
4. **Leverage tech, not labor**  
5. **Avoid debt traps**  
6. **India rewards builders, not traders**

---

# **Hard Truth**

If you:

* Stay employee forever  
* Avoid risk  
* Chase quick money

You **won’t** become a millionaire.
